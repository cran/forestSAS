\title{
A forest spatial structure index characterizing differation degree of tree attributies.
}
\description{
Analyze the differation degree of tree attributies in a neighborhood unit according to the characteristics of the tree attributies,such as forest storey,speices,etc.in spatial micro-environment.which clearly define the differation degree of tree attributies for a reference 
tree and its four nearest neighbors.
}
\usage{
differ(x)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A vector composed by 5 tree attributies.
}
}
\value{
Result will retrun five values,0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1,which means 
one, two, three, four or five different attributies of nearest neighbors 
for reference tree,respectively.
