\title{
A forest spatial structure index characterizing tree dominance
}
\description{
The tree attribute dominance was proposed by Hui et al. (1998) to relate the relative dominance of a given tree to its species or silvicultural significance. It is defined as the proportion of
the n nearest neighbours of a given reference tree which are bigger than the reference tree.
}
\usage{
dominance(x)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A vector composed by 5 tree attributes, such as dbh,biomass.
}
}
\value{
Result will retrun five values,0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1,which means the propertion of
the larger tree attributes in the 4 nearest neighbours than the reference tree.
