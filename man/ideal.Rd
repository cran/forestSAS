\title{
A forest spatial structure index characterizing distribution of ideal state for tree attributies.
}
\description{
Analyze the distribution of ideal state for tree attributies in a neighborhood unit according to the characteristics of the tree attributies,such as tree health,climax species distribution,etc.in spatial micro-environment.which clearly define the ideal degree of tree attributies for a reference tree and its four nearest neighbors.
}
\usage{
ideal(x, para)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A vector composed by 5 tree attributies.
}
  \item{para}{
Ideal state of tree attributies.
}
}
\value{
Result will retrun five values,0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1,which means 
none,one, two, three or four ideal tree attributies of nearest neighbors 
for reference tree,respectively.
