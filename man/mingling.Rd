\title{
A forest spatial structure index characterizing tree diversity
}
\description{
The tree attribute mingling describes the species variety in the vicinity of a given reference tree and has been defined as the proportion of the n nearest neighbours
that do not belong to the same species
}
\usage{
mingling(x)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A vector composed by 5 tree species
}
}
\value{
Result will retrun five values,0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1,which means the propertion of 
the same tree species with refercence tree in the 4 nearest neighbours
